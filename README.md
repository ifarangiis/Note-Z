## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version ^3.7.2)
- Dart (latest stable)
- Mapbox account and access token
- Android Studio/VS Code with Flutter extension
- iOS: XCode (for MacOS users)
- Android: Android Studio with emulator setup

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ifarangiis/Note-Z.git
   cd Note-Z
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
   ```
   MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app in development mode**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   - Android:
     ```bash
     flutter build apk --release
     ```
   - iOS:
     ```bash
     flutter build ios --release
     ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Mapbox Token Issues**: Ensure your token has the proper permissions for the Maps SDK.
- **Build Errors**: Make sure you've set up the platform-specific configurations:
  - Android: Check AndroidManifest.xml for permissions
  - iOS: Verify Info.plist contains the necessary permission declarations

## üß© Technical Explanations

### Architecture Overview

Note-Z follows a simple but effective architecture:
- **Models**: Data structures for notes and other objects
- **Screens**: UI components for different screens
- **Services**: Business logic and external API integrations
- **Utils**: Helper utilities for colors, dates, etc.
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

### Key Components

#### Color System (`color_util.dart`)

The app uses a carefully designed color system that powers its visual identity:

```dart
// Primary colors
static const Color primary = Color(0xFFFF4EC0);       // Pink
static const Color secondary = Color(0xFF6A35FC);     // Purple
```

The color utility provides:
- App theme colors (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Gradient combinations for various UI elements
- A semantic color system for note urgency levels (low, medium, high, past due)
- Helper methods to generate urgency colors based on deadline proximity

This centralized approach ensures consistent branding throughout the app and makes theming changes straightforward.

#### Mapbox Integration (`mapbox_service.dart`)

The `MapboxService` handles all interactions with the Mapbox Maps SDK:

```dart
// Get a cartoon-style map style URI
static String get cartoonStyleUri {
  return 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12';
}
```

Key features:
- **Token Management**: Securely manages the Mapbox access token from environment variables
- **Map Styling**: Configures the map with a cartoon-style appearance
- **Camera Control**: Provides methods for dynamic camera positioning with smooth animations
- **Marker Creation**: Utilities for creating styled markers for notes

To integrate Mapbox in your own Flutter app:
1. Create a Mapbox account and get an access token
2. Add the `mapbox_maps_flutter` package to your pubspec.yaml
3. Create a service similar to `MapboxService` to abstract SDK interactions
4. Initialize the map using `MapWidget` from the SDK
5. Set up map event listeners for user interactions

#### Date Utilities

Note-Z features a smart date system that:
- Calculates days remaining until the weekly reset
- Formats dates in user-friendly ways
- Determines note urgency based on deadline proximity
- Provides custom date picker UI for deadline selection

#### Storage System

The app implements a local-first storage approach:
- Notes are saved to device storage using SharedPreferences
- No data is sent to external servers
- Weekly reset functionality automatically clears notes every Sunday

## üõ†Ô∏è Upcoming Features

- **Weekly Analytics**: Visual statistics of completed vs. pending notes
- **Custom Map Styles**: Additional map themes beyond the cartoon style
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced note search and filtering options
- **Categories & Tags**: Organize notes with custom categories
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support
- **Weather Integration**: Display weather information on the map
- **Multiple Maps**: Support for different map providers
